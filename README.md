3. Create additional compound conditionals that check for the following:
   - If the username is correct AND the password is incorrect, tog to the console "Wrong password - be careful, don't mess this up too many times."
   - If the password is correct AND the username is incorrect, tog to the console "Wrong username - is there a typo?"
   - Finally, if the password is incorrect AND the username is incorrect, log to the console "Incorrect username and password. Hmm. Suspicious."
